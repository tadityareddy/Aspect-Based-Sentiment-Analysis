# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
This Github repository contains code for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Python packages such as seaborn, pandas, and nltk. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is a process of analyzing the opinions and feelings of users after purchasing or using a product. This analysis helps e-commerce companies in understanding the specific aspects of the product that are liked or disliked by users.

The code in this repository uses Natural Language Processing techniques to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis. The code extracts aspects of the product from user reviews and assigns sentiment scores to each aspect. The sentiment scores can be positive, negative, or neutral, and they help companies to understand which aspects of the product are well-liked by users and which aspects need improvement.

The Python packages used in this code make the analysis process faster and more efficient. Seaborn is used for data visualization, pandas for data manipulation, and nltk for natural language processing. With the help of these packages, the analysis process is streamlined, and the results are easy to interpret.

Overall, this Github repository provides a useful tool for e-commerce companies to gain insights into customer sentiment and improve their products accordingly.
